 <h1>🖐️Hi, I'm Ankur. </h1>-->
<h4><p>Welcome to my GitHub profile! As a software engineer, I thrive on collaborating with developers who share my passion, dedication, and keen eye for meticulous design. Though my focus is in android, I'm always looking to venture out and explore new platforms. Whether it's crafting flashy websites or leveraging cutting edge apis like Google Vision, I'm always looking to learn. To me, the user experience is paramount; customizing it requires an agile mindset as well as a knack for teaching myself new technologies. Below, you'll see a variety of projects that I've single-handedly taken from concept to launch, alongside contributions I've made to open-source initiatives. Whether you're interested in collaborating or just want to talk some tech, feel free to reach out.</p></h4>

    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Why is CSS important?</summary>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Can I create interactive websites without JavaScript?</summary>
    <p>While JavaScript is essential for creating highly interactive websites, it's possible to create basic forms of interactivity using only HTML and CSS. This includes using the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> elements for collapsible content, CSS pseudo-classes for interactive styles, and the HTML <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element to capture user inputs.</p>
