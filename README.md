<h1>🖐️Hi, I'm Ankur. </h1>
<p>Welcome to my GitHub profile! As a software engineer, I thrive on collaborating with developers who are passionate and share a keen eye for meticulous design. Although my focus is in android, I do like to venture out and explore new platforms. Whether it is building websites or employing cutting edge apis from Google Vision, I like to leverage both frontend and backend technologies to create a seamless and satisfying user experience. Below, you'll find projects that I've single-handedly taken from concept to launch, alongside contributions I've made to open-source initiatives. Whether you're interested in collaborating or just want to talk some tech and share some ideas, feel free to reach out. My door is always open.</p>

    <li>📱 Android: <a href="https://github.com/abGit9/Pilly_Intro">Pilly App</a> 
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.panacea.pilly&hl=en_US">

    <p>An interactive android app designed to remind users when to take their medications by allowing them to set specific reminder times.</p>
    <li>🌐 Web:                <a href="https://github.com/abGit9/Profile_Web">Online Profile</a></li>
    <p>Seeking to add a personal touch to my resume, I developed an extensive profile website. This site features several pages showcasing my background and experiences, enriched with numerous animations. Feel free to explore!</p>
    <li>☁️ Google Cloud:       <a href="https://github.com/abGit9/Med_Label_Reader">Med_Label_Reader</a></li>
    <p>To address user feedback on the lengthy medical data entry process in my Pilly app, I developed a web service that simplifies this by reading medication labels. Users just snap a photo of their medication label, upload it, and receive the essential med data in return.</p>

    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Why is CSS important?</summary>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Can I create interactive websites without JavaScript?</summary>
    <p>While JavaScript is essential for creating highly interactive websites, it's possible to create basic forms of interactivity using only HTML and CSS. This includes using the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> elements for collapsible content, CSS pseudo-classes for interactive styles, and the HTML <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element to capture user inputs.</p>
